        <ul>
          <h3>What is git? </h3>
          <li>keep track of changes to code, synchronise work/code with different colleagues</li>
          <li>test changes to code without losing the original</li>
          <li>revert back to old version of code!</li>
          
          <h3> Git Clone:</h3>
          <li> take a repository from internet and download it onto your computer (nned the github repo link)</li>
          
          <h3> Git Commit:</h3>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcoBAfJ6l2Q&t=1619s
          <li> save the current state of the files and folders inside the repository and take a snapshot, so that later you can refer back to them</li>
          <li>can use git commit -m "write the meesage u want to convey"</li>
          <img src="Images/Screenshot from 2022-09-25 12-02-43.png" height=300px;>
          <li> if u wanna combine git commit and git add, eg: wanna git add all the files, u can use <strong>git commit -am "message u wanna write here"</strong>
          
          <h3> Git Add:</h3>
          <li> it is use to add a file into a checklist such tht when the next time u wanna save it, git will save all these files you have added. it is kinda      like shortlisting the files you wanna save!</li>
          
          <h3> GIT status:</h3>
          <li> It tells u what is currently happening in ur github repo</li>
          <img src="Images/Screenshot from 2022-09-25 12-17-33.png" >
          <li> your branch is ahed of origin/main : means that ur version is more updated than the one on github. (origin/main is refering to github)</li>
