  <h3> Git Commit:</h3>

  <li> if u wanna combine git commit and git add, eg: wanna git add all the files, u can use <strong>git commit -am "message u wanna write here"</strong>
  
  <h3> Git Add:</h3>
  <li> it is use to add a file into a checklist such tht when the next time u wanna save it, git will save all these files you have added. it is kinda      like shortlisting the files you wanna save!</li>
