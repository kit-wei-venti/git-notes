  <li>keep track of changes to code, synchronise work/code with different colleagues</li>
  <li>test changes to code without losing the original</li>
  <li>revert back to old version of code!</li>
  
  <h3> Git Clone:</h3>
  <li> take a repository from internet and download it onto your computer (nned the github repo link)</li>
  
  <h3> Git Commit:</h3>
  <li> save the current state of the files and folders inside the repository and take a snapshot, so that later you can refer back to them</li>

  <li> if u wanna combine git commit and git add, eg: wanna git add all the files, u can use <strong>git commit -am "message u wanna write here"</strong>
  
  <h3> Git Add:</h3>
  <li> it is use to add a file into a checklist such tht when the next time u wanna save it, git will save all these files you have added. it is kinda      like shortlisting the files you wanna save!</li>
